# 01-product — the product, built in one landing

**Places** every module: the root manifests, CI, tooling, the identity
file, the product's README and its `AGENTS.md` (what an agent reads first); `infra/terraform/cloudflare-kv` (the KV namespace per environment);
`apps/web` (the site — upstream's Worker and its dashboard, the Vite build,
its wrangler template and fixture, its deploy contract); `tests/web`
(vitest). Then brands them, lands them as
ONE pull request, and watches the ONE convergence that merge triggers.

**Budget** about 5 minutes (`expectedMinutes: 5` in `repo-blueprint.yaml`, an
estimate): turso-starter's measured shape (one Terraform root, one Worker,
about five minutes); this site's build is one Vite bundle, with no framework
to compile.

**Requires** both connections live — GitHub (the App installation on the
OWNER of the repository, the only way the platform sees its pull requests)
and Cloudflare (every deploy credential below is minted from it) — probed,
waited for up to ten minutes each, so the consent can be clicked while it
waits.

## What runs

The run's task set-up — the epic, both milestones, both tasks — runs in the
background from the start (`background: true`), so every hook up to `task`
runs beside it; `task` is the first that waits for it.

| hook | what it does |
|---|---|
| `retouch` | the redeploy marker on the components `.baseline/tasks/01-product.TaskContract.yaml` names: `cloudflare-kv`, `web`, `web-tests` |
| `git-init`, `stage`, `rebrand` | the tree becomes a repository, then the product's |
| `orun-workspace` | intent.yaml's `workspace:` becomes the product's (or `ws_SET_ME`, which fails loudly) |
| `work-tree` | intent.yaml's `work:` block — this repository's epics and tasks — is removed |
| `promotion`, `dev-lanes` | prod's promotion gate and dev's push-to-main activation deferred until `02-docs` |
| `restage`, `rebrand-verify` | the sweep: no identity of this baseline left anywhere |
| `repo` | `orun.repo/ensure@v1` creates `<githuborg>/<reponame>` (or finds it) |
| `link` | the repository becomes the workspace's; `orun cloud check` is the gate |
| `secrets` | `orun.integrations/reconcile@v1`, both keys in one hook, created side by side: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` from the `workers-deploy` template (Workers Scripts and KV Storage write, so ONE token applies the namespace and deploys the Worker); `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, the connection fact both bind |
| `task` | finds the phase's task and yields its key — waiting, if it must, for the background set-up |
| `land` | one PR bound to the task, its commit checked in the box first (`checks: local`: `orun validate`, then `orun plan` as the PR and as the merge would plan it, under a second); merged without waiting for the PR's CI |
| `converge` (await) | `orun.run/watch@v1` on the merge commit's run, read every 5 s; resumes it up to three times |
| `verify` (await) | `orun.http/probe@v1` on both workers.dev URLs |

## What the convergence does

`orun plan --changed` on the merge plans, with dev's push activation and the
promotion gate deferred:

| lane | waits on | does |
|---|---|---|
| `cloudflare-kv · stage` / `· prod` | nothing | `terraform apply` of `stg-<reponame>-app-kv-stage` / `prod-<reponame>-app-kv-prod`, adopting a namespace of that title if one exists (`adopt.tf`), then lease-publishes `WIRING_CLOUDFLARE_KV` = `{app_kv_id, app_kv_title}` on that environment |
| `stage · web` / `prod · web` | that environment's KV apply (`dependsOn: cloudflare-kv`, `mode: enforced` on main) | resolves `WIRING_CLOUDFLARE_KV_<ENV>` as it starts, renders `wrangler.jsonc` with the real namespace id, builds the dashboard with Vite, hands the admin token (when stored) to the Worker as a secret, deploys `<reponame>-web-<env>` with its `AI` binding, and smoke-tests it: `/api/health` must answer `"ok":true`, which only the Worker reading its namespace can (it never calls the model), and `/` must serve the dashboard |

Stage and prod run side by side. `web-tests` verifies on dev only, on a
pull request. The landing's own pull request runs `plan` alone, and nothing
waits for it — the same plan ran in the box before the push: the baseline's
own CI installed, type-checked, linted, tested and built this exact tree
before the tag was cut.

## Verified

The convergence run for the merge commit is green — the site's deploys
resolved `WIRING_CLOUDFLARE_KV` from stage and prod, where every later run
reads it; `https://<reponame>-web-{stage,prod}.<subdomain>.workers.dev`
answer.

## Troubleshooting

| symptom | cause → fix |
|---|---|
| parks on the `providers` probe | GitHub (on the repository's owner) or Cloudflare is not connected to the workspace. Connect it (console → Integrations), then re-run the phase — the probe is a wait, not a failure |
| stops at `link` | the repository is not linked to the workspace and the credential cannot link it. Allow-list it (console → Settings → Git repos) and re-run the phase |
| `land`: `the landing's own check failed — orun plan for …` | the placed tree does not plan; the next line is orun's error. Nothing was pushed. Fix it and re-run the phase |
| KV lane: `a namespace with this account ID and title already exists` (10014) | `adopt.tf` imports a namespace of the same title; if it was removed, restore it. Two products with the same `reponame` in one account share a title — use a distinct `reponame` |
| KV lane or deploy lane: Authentication error (10000) | the connection's token lacks Workers Scripts or KV Storage write. Re-issue it with the permission groups the console's Connect recipe lists, re-connect, re-run the phase |
| web lane fails resolving `WIRING_CLOUDFLARE_KV_<ENV>` | that environment's KV apply failed or never ran — read its lane; the web lane waits on it, so it shows as not run on a fresh failure |
| web lane `build-app`: `wire: missing wiring documents` | the job started without the document — the `dependsOn` edge is gone from `apps/web/component.yaml`, or the secretEnv names the wrong key |
| web lane `verify-app-structure`: `test -f wrangler.jsonc` fails | `apps/web/wrangler.jsonc` is not committed (an old `.gitignore` entry); render it with `pnpm run wire:fixture` and commit it |
| smoke fails right after the FIRST deploy | workers.dev route propagation; the composition retries the first deploy and the smoke with backoff (stack-tectonic ≥ 0.19.0). A convergence resume clears what is left |
| the watch says green, the probe says 404 | another workflow ran on the push and the watch took its run. Only `ci.yml` may run on a push to main |
| convergence failed AFTER the PR merged; re-running lands nothing | the hooks did not run (`--run-hooks`), or the contract names no component — `node tooling/bootstrap/retouch.mjs --check --affects .baseline/tasks/01-product.TaskContract.yaml` in the site's tree says which |
| smoke fails: `/api/health` answers 503 with `"kv":false` | the Worker deployed without a reachable namespace binding — read the lane's wiring render; the namespace's apply must have run first |
| `/api/health` answers `"ai":false` | the config lost its `ai` binding; the surfaces still serve, each page enriched by the fallback from its own text |
| deploy lane: the Worker uploads but `/llms.txt` lists every page's `model` as `… (fallback)` | the account's Workers AI refused the model (`AI_MODEL`); the store is cached for a minute and retried. Check Workers AI is enabled on the account |
